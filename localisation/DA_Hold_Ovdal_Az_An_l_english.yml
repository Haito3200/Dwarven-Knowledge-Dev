 DA_Argrastun_Cathedral_Wonder_location_shower_tt:0 "Ovdal-az-Ân was a dwarf hold in the Tree of Stone known as the Hold of One, the home of the most devout Dwarven Pantheon worshippers, the keepers of Vûrodrmonir and raisers of hold hogs. The Granite Dwarves were known for deep study and worship of the gods of the Dwarven Pantheon, building both the Hul-az-Dagrin and the Argrâstun Cathedral. Their devoutness eventually led them to isolate themselves by sealing their hold with runecarved granite from the rest of the holds of the East Serpentspine, believing that the heresy and dangers within the Tree of Stone were too extreme to be ignored. Their isolation was however broken by the Chaingrasper Clan, leading to the fall of the hold in 1439."

 DA_ADK_explore.225.d:0 "Torvin feels his eyes widen in surprise as the rubble falls away, revealing an open space. Quickly, the stones are pulled away and the passage reinforced, allowing him to step into a large room. An altar lay at its centre, its fine decorations revealed as his lamp bring light. Silver inlays, delicate semi-precious stones and fine bas-relief give an iar of solemn gravitas to the altar. Four statues of dwarves, each holding aloft a torch that serves as a brasier, line the room. Of course, the brasiers are long extinguished, and sadly cracked.\nA quiet hum seems to fill the room, as if the echoes of ancient hymns still lingered. All around the room, tools of worship and shattered, once ornate furniture dot the floor.\n\nTorvin is convinced, this is part of the Argrâstun, the spiritual heart of the Dwarven Pantheon. Surely, it is only a secondary shrine, but it is a part of it nonetheless."

They were in a truly gigantic cavern, dominated by a single, titanic stalactite, lovingly decorated with the most beautiful statues he had ever seen. Damestear veins streaked across is, providing illumination and humming with power. Bridges reached across the voids, to smaller but still great stalactites where, no doubt, more shrines laid. On the ground, he could see in the darkness mummified bodies, most certainly the Granite Dwarves that had taken refuge in the Cathedral during the invasion. Torvin could almost hear a melody, one that matched the books of hymns he had found in the previous shrines...\n\nUnbidden, he began to sing in tune with the hum, a prayer of departure ... and a prayer of homecoming."

Before him, on the central altar, and by the grace of Dagrin Everbeard, lay Vûrordrmonir, the divine artifact that was the symbol of office of the High Priestess of Halanna. Truthfully, the only reason he had been allowed to gaze at it first was because of his work in rediscovering and rebuilding the Cathedral, but he felt blessed nonetheless.\n\n'It is even more majestic than I dreamed.' Whispered Ordna Amberheart, the current High Priestess of Halanna, as she came to stand next to Torvin.\n\n'It is.' Torvin answered in a reverent whisper. 'It truly is.'"

As the ages continued, he would in turn create Bugbears and Hobgoblins in an effort to prove himself better than Halanna and her Dwarven children."
