They aim to create a wall of basalt accross the entire width of Uvolate, from mountain to mountain, carve it into a wall and reinforce it with runes. To ensure the magma  keeps flowing over the many leagues it would have to cross, they have also devised runes to generate great heat, which would be carved into pillars erected all along the mageshields. Once the mould has been filled, the pillars would be cast down and the wall left to cool.\nSuch an endeavour would take many years and countless coins if it even is possible, but should it be achieved and their plans be realized, we would have a formidable line of defense to protect our holdings. The architects have already suggested a name for this grand fortification : Verkal Jorkad."

Casemats and caserns were dug into the wall, at regular intervals, making sure no part of the citadel will ever lack soldiers, ammunition, food or beer. Drainage and reservoirs were also carved to collect the rain water, as is the custom in these arid lands. This water can be made drinkable if boiled or car be used to fight fires. Artillery emplacements and embrasures were carved from the wall at different heights, allowing the defenders to apply an exceptional amount of fire on any attacking force.\nEmplacements were singled out all along the wall, within and without, for placing runes.

Great canons, worthy of Kanzadi fortifications, line the bastions that dot our grand citadel, crewed by rune-powered basalt golems.\nTo carry all this heavy equipment into place, three rail lines had to be excavated inside the wall itself, along with seventy lifts all along the length of the wall to manage vertical traffic. Six main rail junctions and twelve lesser junctions ensure that supplies, ammunition and dwarfpower can travel at speed all along the wall to either relieve of reinforce any section that is attacked.\nOne Magni Ironbeard, a Bûradi runesmith and architect has proposed and implemented an ingenious idea, turning many of the prospective water tanks, of which we had far more than was needed, into magma reservoirs instead, making good use of the heating runes that supported the first steps of this project. Now, should we be attacked, specialized drainage pipes will be able to douse the attackers with molten rock.\nIn the shadow of the citadel, small towns has blossomed, housing the famillies of the garrison, worshops tending to the needs of Verkal Jorkad's equipments and hospitals to tend to the health of its garrison.\nIt is done. Uvolate is secured, and none can cross it without walking through the 12 gates spread along Verkal Jorkad.
