DA_Expedition_camp_event.10.d: "[EncounterOverlay]Shortly after taking the secret passage a pack of bugbears come charging from the depths, a crazed look in their eyes, as if we were their archenemy.\nAfter a strenous battle we realized the end of the cave was their den and they charged at us without holding back because this was their children's home, truly unfortunate outcome."

Old houses, shops and some whorkshops in ruin can be seen here and there.
