These entities, reminiscent of resplendent gems, are renowned for their intrinsic pulsation, akin to a heartbeat or breathing lung. However, this is not a mere optical illusion - it's theorized to act as a form of respiration, whereby the crystals draw nutrients from their surroundings and expel waste.\n\nThere's an ongoing debate concerning the capacity of these living crystals to "infect" other organisms and transform them into crystalline lifeforms. There have been accounts of creatures with crystalline growths that seem to proliferate over time. The ambiguity lies in determining whether these growths stem from an infectious process or result merely from prolonged exposure to the crystal's environment.\n\nAmong the biological community, a prevailing theory suggests the crystals' 'infective' process could constitute a form of reproduction or propagation. This theory proposes that crystals may implant shards or spores into organisms that come into contact with them. These fragments could then mature and evolve into new crystals over time.\n\nRegarding the crystals' ability to adopt mobile forms, the current hypothesis leans towards mimicry or adaptation. In a world where mobility often translates into survival, the crystals may have developed this capability to work and interact with their environment. This adaptive strategy might also account for their apparent aggression - in the harsh environment of the Serpentspine, competition for resources is unavoidable among various lifeforms.\n\nAlternatively, it's proposed that the perceived 'aggression' might not fit our typical understanding of animal behavior. Rather than intentional harm, the crystals might be demonstrating purely instinctive or reflexive responses, similar to a plant orienting towards sunlight or a single-celled organism moving towards nutrients. Hence, the crystals' behaviors could be interpreted as simple reactions to environmental stimuli, devoid of malicious intent or conscious thought."

These organisms are biologically remarkable and possess characteristics that suggest a shared ancestry with the sandworms of Harafe. Their main activity revolves around burrowing through rock and earth, creating extensive networks of tunnels as they traverse the Serpentspine depths. It's speculated that much of the intricate cave system within the Serpentspine Mountains can be attributed to these massive burrowers.\n\nServing as a critical component of the Serpentspine ecosystem, the Purple Worms contribute significantly to its balance. They consume organisms that many other species would deem inedible, such as Shriekers and violet fungi, which are prolific within the mountain range. Shriekers, a type of fungi capable of emitting loud sounds, and their symbiotic partners, the violet fungi, use necrotic poison to kill their prey. By feeding on these organisms, the Purple Worms control their populations, preventing overgrowth that could disrupt the intricate balance of the cave's ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to shaping the physical landscape, the extensive tunnel networks created by the Purple Worms serve as homes and pathways for the Grue, scavenger creatures that utilize these burrows to their advantage. This relationship demonstrates a form of commensal symbiosis, in which the Grue benefit from the Purple Worms' activities without providing any substantial advantage in return.\n\nWithin the archives of Dwarven lore, there is a fascinating but controversial theory that suggests the ancient Dwarves may have harnessed the power of these gargantuan creatures in the construction of their extensive railway systems. Despite the fantastical narrative and the implied technological prowess, this theory lacks definitive archaeological evidence. Most scholars, including renowned biologists, consider it improbable due to the enormous challenges associated with controlling such large creatures.

They are hunters of children, and they especially like to feed on infants. On rare occasions, however, an Adze has been hired by particularly evil people to kill an adult as an assassin.
