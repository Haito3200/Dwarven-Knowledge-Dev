These entities, reminiscent of resplendent gems, are renowned for their intrinsic pulsation, akin to a heartbeat or breathing lung. However, this is not a mere optical illusion - it's theorized to act as a form of respiration, whereby the crystals draw nutrients from their surroundings and expel waste.\n\nThere's an ongoing debate concerning the capacity of these living crystals to "infect" other organisms and transform them into crystalline lifeforms. There have been accounts of creatures with crystalline growths that seem to proliferate over time. The ambiguity lies in determining whether these growths stem from an infectious process or result merely from prolonged exposure to the crystal's environment.\n\nAmong the biological community, a prevailing theory suggests the crystals' 'infective' process could constitute a form of reproduction or propagation. This theory proposes that crystals may implant shards or spores into organisms that come into contact with them. These fragments could then mature and evolve into new crystals over time.\n\nRegarding the crystals' ability to adopt mobile forms, the current hypothesis leans towards mimicry or adaptation. In a world where mobility often translates into survival, the crystals may have developed this capability to work and interact with their environment. This adaptive strategy might also account for their apparent aggression - in the harsh environment of the Serpentspine, competition for resources is unavoidable among various lifeforms.\n\nAlternatively, it's proposed that the perceived 'aggression' might not fit our typical understanding of animal behavior. Rather than intentional harm, the crystals might be demonstrating purely instinctive or reflexive responses, similar to a plant orienting towards sunlight or a single-celled organism moving towards nutrients. Hence, the crystals' behaviors could be interpreted as simple reactions to environmental stimuli, devoid of malicious intent or conscious thought."

 DA_Tech_Alchemy_Material_Event.215.d:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Purple Worms are colossal burrowing creatures native to the Serpentspine Mountains. These organisms are biologically remarkable and possess characteristics that suggest a shared ancestry with the sandworms of Harafe. Their main activity revolves around burrowing through rock and earth, creating extensive networks of tunnels as they traverse the Serpentspine depths. It's speculated that much of the intricate cave system within the Serpentspine Mountains can be attributed to these massive burrowers.\n\nServing as a critical component of the Serpentspine ecosystem, the Purple Worms contribute significantly to its balance. They consume organisms that many other species would deem inedible, such as Shriekers and violet fungi, which are prolific within the mountain range. Shriekers, a type of fungi capable of emitting loud sounds, and their symbiotic partners, the violet fungi, use necrotic poison to kill their prey. By feeding on these organisms, the Purple Worms control their populations, preventing overgrowth that could disrupt the intricate balance of the cave's ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to shaping the physical landscape, the extensive tunnel networks created by the Purple Worms serve as homes and pathways for the Grue, scavenger creatures that utilize these burrows to their advantage. This relationship demonstrates a form of commensal symbiosis, in which the Grue benefit from the Purple Worms' activities without providing any substantial advantage in return.\n\nWithin the archives of Dwarven lore, there is a fascinating but controversial theory that suggests the ancient Dwarves may have harnessed the power of these gargantuan creatures in the construction of their extensive railway systems. Despite the fantastical narrative and the implied technological prowess, this theory lacks definitive archaeological evidence. Most scholars, including renowned biologists, consider it improbable due to the enormous challenges associated with controlling such large creatures. However, given the impressive capabilities of the ancient Aul-Dwarov, some continue to speculate. As such, the matter remains a topic of ongoing study and debate until conclusive evidence can be found."

It's speculated that much of the intricate cave system within the Serpentspine Mountains can be attributed to these massive burrowers.\n\nServing as a critical component of the Serpentspine ecosystem, the Purple Worms contribute significantly to its balance. They consume organisms that many other species would deem inedible, such as Shriekers and violet fungi, which are prolific within the mountain range. Shriekers, a type of fungi capable of emitting loud sounds, and their symbiotic partners, the violet fungi, use necrotic poison to kill their prey. By feeding on these organisms, the Purple Worms control their populations, preventing overgrowth that could disrupt the intricate balance of the cave's ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to shaping the physical landscape, the extensive tunnel networks created by the Purple Worms serve as homes and pathways for the Grue, scavenger creatures that utilize these burrows to their advantage. This relationship demonstrates a form of commensal symbiosis, in which the Grue benefit from the Purple Worms' activities without providing any substantial advantage in return.\n\nWithin the archives of Dwarven lore, there is a fascinating but controversial theory that suggests the ancient Dwarves may have harnessed the power of these gargantuan creatures in the construction of their extensive railway systems. Despite the fantastical narrative and the implied technological prowess, this theory lacks definitive archaeological evidence. Most scholars, including renowned biologists, consider it improbable due to the enormous challenges associated with controlling such large creatures. However, given the impressive capabilities of the ancient Aul-Dwarov, some continue to speculate. As such, the matter remains a topic of ongoing study and debate until conclusive evidence can be found."

Amongst the lizardfolk, tchoken are kept as farm animals and form a central part of their diet.\n\nIt has also become a byword for stupidity due to the tchoken's clumsiness and slow-witted nature, as well as the ease it takes to convince one to walk into a trap. Despite this, tchoken are remarkably resilient. They are unique amongst most creatures in that they're seemingly immune to planar magic, or indeed any magic at all. This is especially noticeable in the Shadow Swamp, where the monochrome surroundings will occasionally be broken by the vivid colors of a lost tchoken.\n\nAlthough most common in Taneyas, the tchoken can be found across southern Sarhal, although they require very damp climates to live and so are more commonly found in areas that experience monsoons. Their biology is more similar to the lizardfolk than other creatures of Halann, leading to speculation that the tchoken is a form of lizardfolk mutation.

A roc's diet consists primarily of large ground mammals, such as livestock, horses, and even mammoths. Despite their similarity to prey species, it is incredibly rare for a centaur to be carried off by a roc.\n\nDue to their diet, the vast majority of roc sightings occur in the Forbidden Plains, where prey is plentiful, and hunters and poachers are relatively few. This is not to say that rocs have not been sighted outside of the Forbidden Plains; sightings are frequent enough in Bulwar that the residents are familiar with the beasts, and one need not search too hard in Haless to find a merchant selling high-end products such as roc eggs or feathers."

If their gigantic size and terrifying strength weren't enough, the barzoazh are unnaturally swift in water, making their primary strategy water ambushes from rivers and lakes. Combined together, the barzoazh is treated as an oppressive, unflinching, and uncaring harbinger of death, finality, and fate on the Forbidden Plains. Hunting such creatures is possible, but even a seasoned adventuring band or experienced hunting party will find doom lurking in the barzoazh's' all-consuming jaw.

A full herd can recreate an orchestra with melodious ease, and an irate shadhavar can channel a powerful blast like a sonic cannon capable of shattering bones, eardrums, and minds. The shadhavar's horn is a prized material for instrument making, especially among bards, skalds, and storytellers. Because of this, shadhavar are generally skittish of mortals, but the peoples of the Forbidden Plains know dozens of legends that revolve around noble and creative souls who make concert with shadhavar as an exhibition of skill and renown. As herbivores, shadhavars shirk violence, save only to defend the weaker creatures and environments they seek to protect."
