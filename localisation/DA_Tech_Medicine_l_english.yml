DA_Tech_Medicine_event.100.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Marsh Fever"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.100.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nMarsh Fever is a dreaded illness that festers in the humid lowlands, tangled swamps, and stagnant river deltas of the world. It spreads swiftly among fisherfolk, kobold marsh-clans, and halfling settlements nestled in the reeds. Locals speak of the 'Swampfire' as a lurking spirit, carried on the wings of biting insects.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Sudden, violent chills\n- Burning fever and relentless sweating\n- Vomiting, weakness, and vivid fever-dreams\n\nSome claim it is the curse of the swamp itself, a punishment for draining sacred wetlands or disturbing old barrow-mounds."
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.100.a:0 "Ashen Skies!"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.100.b:0 "Just distribute the cure to the population"
 DA_already_researched_cure_tt:0 "You have already researched the cure for this Illness!"

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.101.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Red Cough"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.101.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nThe Red Cough is an affliction of the lungs, born from soot-choked skies and the filth of crowded cities. Among dwarves, it is known as 'Iron Throat'; among goblins, 'Gutter Breath.' It spreads through the stale air of foundries, mines, and slums, whispering death through the smoke.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Persistent, racking coughs\n- Blood-speckled phlegm\n- Chest pain and growing breathlessness\n\nSome dwarves say the cough is the price of greed—that the mountain takes its toll for every gem and ingot pulled from its belly."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.102.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Flu"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.102.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nFlu is maybe the most common and moderately serious illness in Halann. Though often mild, it can move like wildfire through cities, feasting on the weak and weary.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Fever and chills\n- Sore throat and aching limbs\n- Harsh coughing and prolonged fatigue\n\nHerbalists boil Ironroot and Duskfern against it, though most trust only time, rest, and a strong constitution to see them through."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.103.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Gutrot"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.103.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nGutrot is the curse of unclean kitchens, spoiled meat, and stagnant water. It spreads quickly among marching armies, siege camps, and famine-stricken villages. Known among soldiers as the 'Camp Curse,' it strikes without mercy, turning strong men into trembling husks within hours.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Intense abdominal cramping\n- Vomiting and foul diarrhea\n- Fever, dehydration, and weakness\n\nOld wives say you can smell the death on a man with Gutrot—like rotting onions, sour ale, and grave mold all at once."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.110.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Duskwither Plague"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.110.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nDuskwither Plague is a rare and terrifying illness that emerges from forgotten places—ancient barrows, cursed forests, and stagnant marshes where the air lies heavy and old magic lingers. Elven lorekeepers believe it once followed the march of a doomed god through the woods of Tir-Bahadur.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Sudden, blistering fever\n- Skin mottled with dark purple blotches\n- Seizures and delirious visions\n\nVictims are said to 'wither with the dusk,' collapsing just as the sun dips below the trees, their breath stolen by shadows older than memory."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.111.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Silent Pox"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.111.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nSilentpox moves like a shadow through crowded halls and noble courts. At first, it shows no sign, no cough, no rash, no fever—only stillness. When symptoms appear, it is already too late. Many claim it is not a disease at all, but a curse cast without word or gesture.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Sudden onset of high fever\n- Rapid loss of motor function\n- Paralysis, followed by coma\n\nScholars whisper that Silentpox was first born in the obsidian towers of cursed Aelantir, and that it remembers the blood of kings."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.112.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Redblight"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.112.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nRedblight is a gruesome affliction known to those who work among blood and beasts—herders, slaughterers, and handlers of wild livestock. It begins with a rash, but spreads rapidly through the nervous system, leaving behind a trail of ruined senses. In some regions, it is believed to be the wrath of nature for spilling too much innocent blood.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Itching rashes and blistered skin\n- Swollen eyes and sudden blindness\n- Fever, vertigo, and bleeding gums\n\nFarmers speak of animals acting strangely before an outbreak—cattle weep blood, hounds howl at nothing, and crows circle in silence."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.113.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Chulklung"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.113.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nChalklung is the silent killer of quarrymen, masons, and deep-delve dwarves. Caused by breathing in the fine powder of certain white stones and magical ores, it settles in the lungs like dust in a tomb. Once it takes hold, there is no cure—only time, and less of it.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Dry, rasping cough that worsens with exertion\n- White or grey phlegm, often laced with blood\n- Crippling shortness of breath and chest pain\n\nOld dwarves say you can hear the stone whisper in a man's lungs when the end draws near—like a cave-in waiting to happen."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.120.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Mana Overload"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.120.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nMana Overload is an Illness which can afflict those who reside in High magical territories, like the deep woods, the shadow swamp or even just territories rich in damestear and precursor relics\n\nSymptoms:\n- Glowing veins and burning skin\n- Involuntary bursts of wild magic\n- Seizures, hallucinations, and magical discharges\n\nThe afflicted often whisper runes in their sleep and bleed glyphs from their eyes, their bodies no longer fully part of this world."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.121.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Mana Corruption"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.121.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nMana Corruption is, as the Mana Overload, an Illness which can afflict those who reside in High magical territories, like the deep woods, the shadow swamp or even just territories rich in damestear and precursor relics. The Mana Corruption is worse then The Mana Overload for a simple reason it has na higher mortality rate and it is transmissible to others.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Glowing dark veins and freezing skin\n- Involuntary bursts of magic\n- Seizures, hallucinations, and magical discharges"

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.122.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Metallic Corrosion"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.122.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nMetallic Corrosion is a strange, arcane disease that afflicts those who spend too long near Arcane metal, enchanted forges, or cursed constructs. Some scholars insist it is not a disease, but a progressive poisoning induced by high-mana rich metals/equipment.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Blood becomes hot and thick like molten metal\n- Persistent cough emitting smoke or ash\n- Skin hardens into iridescent, scale-like patches"

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.123.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Soulblight"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.123.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nSoulblight is not a sickness of the flesh, but of the essence. Victims waste away without visible cause, their life dimming as if drained by unseen hands. Clerics say it feels like a candle being snuffed out, while necromancers claim to hear the soul weeping as it fades. The disease often begins with dreams of forgetting, and ends with complete spiritual emptiness.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Fatigue with no physical explanation\n- Skin paling and eyes losing focus\n- Progressive emotional numbness and silence of the soul\n\nSurvivors rarely remember who they once were. The rest are said to walk the veil between life and death, forever hollow."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.130.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Dreams of Reality"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.130.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nDreams of Reality is a mind-altering Illness, sometimes even defined as a curse, which provokes very unsettling hallucinations and nightmares into its victims\n\nSymptoms:\n- Vivid hallucinations and dream-memory confusion\n- Involuntary muttering of imagined events\n- Occasional dreams of standing perfectly still, watching a rectangular glowing glass, for hours\n\nVictims start to distance themselves from society and their jobs, saying 'working a 9-5 is not life' and then, in the final stage of the illness, they often end up killing themselves with a note on the side saying: 'How many times do I have to reroll until I respawn as the king of something?'"

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.131.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Godscar"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.131.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nGodscar is not spoken of in temples—only in whispers behind locked doors and burned chapels. Said to be a divine punishment laid upon mortals who trespass in forbidden sanctums or wield relics not meant for mortal hands, it scours the body from within as if marked by the hand of a wrathful god. Both holy and unholy energies burn in the afflicted, searing flesh and soul alike.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Radiant boils and searing lesions\n- Hallucinations of divine or infernal beings\n- Light bleeding from the eyes, mouth, and wounds\n\nSome believe the Godscar is a mark of chosen doom—a sign that a mortal has glimpsed too far beyond the veil of divinity and survived, but not unscathed."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.132.t:0 "§RIllness§!: White Thorns"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.132.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nWhite Thorns is a rare and horrific curse said to stem from broken pacts with ancient forest spirits or the betrayal of dryadic blood. Victims first feel a tingling beneath the skin, which soon gives way to ivory-white thorns erupting from bone and muscle. Some druids claim it is the forest reclaiming the body, punishing those who once promised to protect it.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Sharp pain in joints and spine\n- Thorny growths piercing the skin from within\n- Bleeding, fever, and loss of movement as the body stiffens\n\nThose claimed by the White Thorns are sometimes found rooted in place, their mouths filled with moss and their eyes turned to bark."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.140.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Seven Deadly Sins"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.140.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nCrafted by a forgotten cabal of godless mages, this arcane curse afflicts the spirit rather than the flesh. Victims succumb not to fever or rot, but to consuming compulsions—each embodying one of the seven mortal sins. It does not kill quickly, but corrupts utterly, twisting the soul toward ruin.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Obsession with carnal or material excess (Lust, Gluttony, Greed)\n- Uncontrolled rage, envy, pride, or apathy\n- Physical degradation corresponding to the dominant sin\n\nThose afflicted may sprout additional limbs, bleed molten gold, or ignite with wrathful flame. The curse feeds on sin, growing stronger with every indulgence. No one suffers all seven and survives."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.141.t:0 "§RIllness§!: Bender of Will"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.141.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nThis curse is not caught—it is placed, by design. Often used by tyrants, slavers, or warlocks, Bender of Will unravels the victim’s sense of self until only obedience remains. It targets the mind through sigils, enchantments, or cursed words spoken in dreams. Victims retain memories—but lose the ability to resist.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Gradual loss of autonomy and decision-making\n- Dreams filled with commands, voids, and watchers\n- Emotionless compliance followed by identity collapse\n\nIn the final stage, the cursed speak in mirrored tongues and act without blinking, serving masters even they cannot name. Breaking the curse risks destroying what’s left of the original mind."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.142.t:0 "§RIllness§!: White Pestilence"
 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.142.d:0 "An Illness has been found in the province!\n\nThe White Pestilence was an undead plague that afflicted Cannor from 1040 - 1053 when it was ended by the Aldresian Crusade. Its namesake was gained as one of the major symptoms was a deathly white pallor that would occur right before death (before the victim was shortly resurrected as a zombie). The event depopulated much of Cannor, and was a major cause in the rise of elves and the Silver Families.\n\nNow somebody managed to recreate it and sent it to you, good luck, you will need it"
