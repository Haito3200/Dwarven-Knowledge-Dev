It spreads swiftly among fisherfolk, kobold marsh-clans, and halfling settlements nestled in the reeds. Locals speak of the 'Swampfire' as a lurking spirit, carried on the wings of biting insects.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Sudden, violent chills\n- Burning fever and relentless sweating\n- Vomiting, weakness, and vivid fever-dreams\n\nSome claim it is the curse of the swamp itself, a punishment for draining sacred wetlands or disturbing old barrow-mounds."

Among dwarves, it is known as 'Iron Throat'; among goblins, 'Gutter Breath.' It spreads through the stale air of foundries, mines, and slums, whispering death through the smoke.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Persistent, racking coughs\n- Blood-speckled phlegm\n- Chest pain and growing breathlessness\n\nSome dwarves say the cough is the price of greed—that the mountain takes its toll for every gem and ingot pulled from its belly."

In some regions, it is believed to be the wrath of nature for spilling too much innocent blood.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Itching rashes and blistered skin\n- Swollen eyes and sudden blindness\n- Fever, vertigo, and bleeding gums\n\nFarmers speak of animals acting strangely before an outbreak—cattle weep blood, hounds howl at nothing, and crows circle in silence."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.131.d:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Illness has been found in the province!\n\nGodscar is not spoken of in temples—only in whispers behind locked doors and burned chapels. Said to be a divine punishment laid upon mortals who trespass in forbidden sanctums or wield relics not meant for mortal hands, it scours the body from within as if marked by the hand of a wrathful god. Both holy and unholy energies burn in the afflicted, searing flesh and soul alike.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Radiant boils and searing lesions\n- Hallucinations of divine or infernal beings\n- Light bleeding from the eyes, mouth, and wounds\n\nSome believe the Godscar is a mark of chosen doom—a sign that a mortal has glimpsed too far beyond the veil of divinity and survived, but not unscathed."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.132.d:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Illness has been found in the province!\n\nWhite Thorns is a rare and horrific curse said to stem from broken pacts with ancient forest spirits or the betrayal of dryadic blood. Victims first feel a tingling beneath the skin, which soon gives way to ivory-white thorns erupting from bone and muscle. Some druids claim it is the forest reclaiming the body, punishing those who once promised to protect it.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Sharp pain in joints and spine\n- Thorny growths piercing the skin from within\n- Bleeding, fever, and loss of movement as the body stiffens\n\nThose claimed by the White Thorns are sometimes found rooted in place, their mouths filled with moss and their eyes turned to bark."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.140.d:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Illness has been found in the province!\n\nCrafted by a forgotten cabal of godless mages, this arcane curse afflicts the spirit rather than the flesh. Victims succumb not to fever or rot, but to consuming compulsions—each embodying one of the seven mortal sins. It does not kill quickly, but corrupts utterly, twisting the soul toward ruin.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Obsession with carnal or material excess (Lust, Gluttony, Greed)\n- Uncontrolled rage, envy, pride, or apathy\n- Physical degradation corresponding to the dominant sin\n\nThose afflicted may sprout additional limbs, bleed molten gold, or ignite with wrathful flame. The curse feeds on sin, growing stronger with every indulgence. No one suffers all seven and survives."

 DA_Tech_Medicine_event.141.d:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Illness has been found in the province!\n\nThis curse is not caught—it is placed, by design. Often used by tyrants, slavers, or warlocks, Bender of Will unravels the victim's sense of self until only obedience remains. It targets the mind through sigils, enchantments, or cursed words spoken in dreams. Victims retain memories—but lose the ability to resist.\n\nSymptoms:\n- Gradual loss of autonomy and decision-making\n- Dreams filled with commands, voids, and watchers\n- Emotionless compliance followed by identity collapse\n\nIn the final stage, the cursed speak in mirrored tongues and act without blinking, serving masters even they cannot name. Breaking the curse risks destroying what's left of the original mind."

The event depopulated much of Cannor, and was a major cause in the rise of elves and the Silver Families.\n\nNow somebody managed to recreate it and sent it to you, good luck, you will need it"
