 DA_ADK_explore.221.t:0 "§gTitanium Vault§!, Surface Vaults"
 DA_ADK_explore.221.d:0 "Captain Basalthand is the first to enter the cavernous room, and finds himself in a bastion at the top of it. It is large and deep, circular but not domed. The upper walls are dotted with fortified emplacements and firing positions, all overlooking the depth of the room to form overlapping fields of fire. Old Dwarovian cannons, rusted to unusability, still wait in their emplacements. And, of course, a good half of the fortification is shattered and ravaged, most likely by the cause of the Hold's fall. Looking down over the parapet, Basalthand finds six levels of fortification, all turned inwards, all glaring at the fortified doors at the bottom of the room. Basalthand squints, something is wrong at the lower levels …\n\nA fortified freight lift once descended through all the fortifications and to the bottom, but it is now shattered and ruined, so the expedition is forced to use the stairs that connect the levels. It is a rather dangerous process as weaken walls have to be reinforced or forcefully collapsed, rubble has to be excavated and slickened steps have to be made useable. Nonetheless, the expedition finally reaches the bottom. A faint, iridescent mist clings to the floor, seemingly coming from the doors leading down. At first, it seems harmless, but the closer the expeditionaries get to the door, the thicker the mist seems to get. One soldier gets close enough that it reaches his face, and almost immediately collapses in a coughing fit. Basalthand immediately orders a measured retreat, the coughing soldier being dragged back by his comrades in arms. A few more soldiers inhale the mist and start coughing too before the entire force is safely back on the upper level.\nBasalthand frowns at this unexpected obstacle. The Vaults of Gor Vazumbrog will not give up their bounty easily."

 DA_ADK_explore.224.d:0 "After weeks of cautious exploration, the expedition reached what they believed to be the deepest chamber of the ancient dwarven hold. The air grew warmer as they descended, thick with a sulfuric tang that clung to their throats. At last, they entered a vast, domed cavern. There, atop a bed of glittering treasure mixed with cracked stone, lay a dragon.\nIts scales shimmered of an othrwordly purple, and its eyes glowed faintly in the dim light. The creature regarded them lazily, its massive head resting on crossed claws. When they hesitated, its voice rumbled through the chamber, low and resonant, like distant thunder.\n'Brave, but foolish,' the dragon said, its words tinged with amusement. 'I have had many names but most know me as the Hunter of The Deeps, and I have called this place home, even if your kind inhabitated it before.'\nThe team froze, unsure whether to bow, flee, or speak. It huffed, a cloud of warm air rolling toward them.\n'I commend your courage for coming this far, but I assure you, there is nothing for you here. These halls no longer belong to dwarves—or to you.'\nThe dragon shifted slightly, the sound of its scales rasping against stone filling the cavern. 'Go back the way you came. And do not return. I do not seek trouble, but neither will I tolerate being disturbed.'\nWithout waiting for a reply, the Hunter of The Deeps closed his eyes, his breathing slowing as though the conversation had already ended.\nThe leader of the expedition swallowed hard and motioned for the others to retreat. As they left, the dragon's deep, rumbling chuckle echoed behind them, filling the halls long after they had gone."

 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.1.d:0 "As it turned out, the Mist was not easily vanquished, far from it. Captain Basalthand is now the commanding officer of the Vault Guard and de facto mayor of the garrison city that has established itself in the Vault's fortified entrance. The fortifications are being rebuilt, the living quarters are restored, the expedition is now the core of the Vault Guard, and their families have come to settle. Through it all, the Mist remains, iridescent, ethereal ... deadly.\n\nMages and apothecaries have been working tirelessly to pierce the secrets of the Mist, to explain why antidotes and spells seem to inevitably fail, why some last longer, why some falter immediately. But now, they have an answer, and Basalthand is eager for answers.\n\n'Fungi. They're magical fungi spores mutated by dragonbreath. They mutate all the time. It's not even conscious.” The lead apothecary, Master Jadebrow, a stout and wise dwarf, hammers down his answer, apparently angry at the solution. In a way, Basalthand understands. Being countered over several years by an Orc would be vexing enough, but by the equivalent of a particularly aggressive bnunin ? That would be incredibly insulting.\n\nDo you have a way for us to walk through it?'\n\nJadebrow sighs heavily, obviously one failed experiment away from declaring a grudge on the mushrooms.\n\n'Nothing permanent. We have devised potions and spells that, in combination, can last for a fairly long time, but our expeditionaries will need to come back before they run out. We're hoping we can develop more … permanent solutions, but the dragonbreath component will corrode enchantments so that's a dead end. And with the number of different species involved, killing them all off would take...'\nJadebrow makes a face."

 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.35.t:0 "§gTitanium Vault§!: Algorithm of Eternity"
 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.35.d:0 "Deep within the Titanium Vaults, the expedition discovers a strange stone tablet, etched with impossibly small runes, spirals of numbers, and faintly glowing symbols. Resting beside it is a leather-bound journal, warped by age, attributed to Kolgrim 'The Infinite', a long-forgotten dwarven genius.\nThe notes are lucid at first—an exploration of mathematics as the key to eternity—but they quickly dissolve into obsession:\n\n'The Algorithm will rewrite the constants of existence. To solve it is to transcend.'\nThe last entry is written shakily:\n\n'If my body cannot endure eternity, my mind shall.'\nThe runes on the tablet shimmer faintly when touched, but no immediate harm befalls those who look at it. The expedition's head researcher, Vordin, an eccentric and socially awkward dwarf, volunteers to bring the tablet to the surface, declaring that it holds the key to unlocking 'the greatest mathematical truth in history.'"
 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.35.b:0 "Stop him!"

 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.350.t:0 "§gAlgorithm of Eternity§!: Oddity"
 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.350.d:0 "Back in the stronghold, Vordin dedicates himself to studying the Algorithm. At first, nothing seems unusual, except that Vordin begins muttering under his breath. Scholars and colleagues grow uneasy:\nThey catch him pausing mid-sentence as though listening to something they cannot hear.\nAt odd hours, his chamber echoes with murmurs—two voices in conversation, though only Vordin is present."

Through prolonged exposure to the tablet, Kolgrim's consciousness, encoded within the runes, has transferred itself into Vordin's mind. Yet, strangely, Vordin seems fine. Stable. He insists there's no problem:\n\n'Kolgrim's presence is harmless. We think together, you see. Two minds are better than one.'\nVordin's behavior becomes peculiar but not alarming—he sometimes laughs at private jokes, refers to himself in the plural, or trails off into bouts of intense calculation. His colleagues observe him with trepidation, uncertain whether his 'coexistence' is a miracle or a ticking time bomb."
 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.351.a:0 "Peculiar"

 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.352.t:0 "§gAlgorithm of Eternity§!: Advancements"
 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.352.d:0 "With Kolgrim's insight augmenting Vordin's genius, the pace of research accelerates dramatically. Vordin begins solving previously unsolvable mathematical problems with ease, pushing the limits of dwarven understanding. The Algorithm itself seems less like an impossibility and more like a challenge to overcome.\n\nOther scholars remain wary but cannot deny the results—Vordin (or Vordin and Kolgrim) unlocks formulas that reshape rune-crafting and mechanical engineering.\n\nHe speaks enthusiastically of progress:\n\n'Kolgrim couldn't finish it in his time, but now we have each other. Together, we will solve eternity.'"

 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.353.d:0 "Months later, Vordin declares a stunning revelation: he and Kolgrim are on the brink of solving the Algorithm. His excitement is infectious—half the scholars rejoice at the progress, while the other half warn against meddling with such profound forces.\nThe final step requires 'anchoring' the solution, inscribing the completed equation onto a perfect medium—perhaps the very stone tablet that started it all. Vordin prepares for the ritual with manic energy, Kolgrim's guidance steady and unwavering."

He carves the last sequences of runes into the stone, his hands guided by a voice only he can hear. The numbers glow, pulsing with rhythm like a heartbeat.\n\nWhen the final rune is etched, the stone tablet flares with an impossible light. For a moment, time seems to freeze. Then the glow fades, and Vordin collapses."

 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.355.d:0 "'We have seen eternity. The Algorithm is perfect. I am… we are… eternal.''\n\nWhat this perfection means becomes evident soon after:\n\nVordin no longer eats, drinks, or sleeps. His body does not age; wounds heal without explanation.\nWherever he walks, reality distorts faintly—stones hum with energy, numbers appear burned into nearby surfaces, and clocks skip seconds.\nHe speaks of 'existing outside time' and 'transcending the limits of form.'\nYet Vordin—still polite, still himself—does not seek power or control. He continues his work, cataloging his discoveries, claiming:\n'There is no end to knowledge. Kolgrim and I will explore it together.'\nThe council is paralyzed. Vordin has achieved eternity, but at what cost? He has become something other—no longer fully dwarf, no longer bound by the laws of life and death."

 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.356.d:0 "Fear spreads through the stronghold as Vordin's mere presence begins to destabilize reality. Numbers flicker in firelight, dwarves lose track of time, and echoes of Kolgrim's voice can be heard in the halls.\nRecognizing the danger, Vordin makes a final, startling request to the council:\n\n'We must be sealed. The Algorithm cannot be contained, but we can. For your sake, and ours.'\n\nHe carries the glowing stone tablet back to its Titanium Vault and willingly seals himself inside. The last thing the council hears before the great rune-locks close is Vordin's voice, still steady:\n\n'Do not mourn us. We have eternity.'\n\nThe vault is warded with the strongest magic and buried deep, surrounded by warnings to never open it."

Yet, one fateful day, a faint hum resonates through the stronghold—a pulse of sound so subtle it seems more imagined than heard.\nIn the council chamber, the High King and their advisors gather as the echo sharpens into a voice, clear yet layered, both familiar and alien:\n'Ruler of the mountain… hear us.'\nThe voice belongs to Vordin and Kolgrim, speaking as one, yet distinct:\n'A century of thought has borne fruit. We have learned much, and we wish to share our knowledge. But we cannot leave. To open the vault would be to undo the balance of existence.'\nThe voice continues, resonating with unearthly calm:\n'Bring your brightest scholars to the edge of the seal. Let us teach them what we have discovered. Let our eternity serve the living.'\nThe stronghold trembles with the weight of the decision. Vordin's offer promises breakthroughs beyond comprehension"

The expedition followed fragmentary maps and journal notes, braving cave-ins, forgotten traps, and the weight of centuries pressing down on them. When they finally emerged into the City of Shifting Stone, their torches revealed a sight both wondrous and eerie: a lifeless city of towers, arches, and halls, all shifting continuously like the heartbeat of a long-dead giant.\nThe explorers tread cautiously, their footsteps echoing in the ever-moving streets. They encountered no life, only the hum of magical runes embedded in every surface. A sense of purpose lingered in the air, as if the city itself awaited them—or perhaps sought to repel them."

 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.362.d:0 "At the city's center, they found it: the Gate of Impossible Light. Its brilliance defied comprehension, a swirling portal that seemed to pull at the edges of their minds. Inscriptions around the gate told the story of the Obsidian Empire's exodus. This portal, it seemed, had been their final escape from some terrible force unleashed by Aul-Dwarov. The runes also warned of the cost: 'The light preserves; the light consumes.'\n\nSome of the explorers wanted to turn back, but others, driven by greed or ambition, began testing the gate's defenses. The city responded with wrath. Walls shifted violently, cutting off escape routes. Runes flared, releasing bursts of energy that reduced careless intruders to ash.\n\nSurvivors who fled the city carried with them fragments of ancient relics and knowledge—but also nightmares of shifting stone and whispers from beyond the gate."

The Primeval Serpentspine is a vast network of caverns filled with vibrant, glowing flora, colossal fungi, and strange rivers of luminescent liquid. The air thrums with an unnatural energy, and massive crystalline structures grow like trees in the darkness.\nThe explorers face immediate challenges: predatory creatures with bizarre, shifting forms stalk the tunnels, and the flora itself seems semi-sentient, reacting to their movements.

 DA_Hold_Gor_Vazumbrog.37.d:0 "Forged in the primordial dawn of existence, long before the rise of Aul-Dwarov and the dwarven empire's grand forges, Aetherium Ingots are the physical embodiment of divine perfection. Each ingot is a miracle in metal, suffused with mana so pure that it seems to radiate an aura of sanctity, commanding awe and reverence from all who behold it.\n\nThe surface of an Aetherium ingot glimmers with an ever-shifting luminescence, as if capturing the essence of starlight trapped within a flowing, liquid-solid form. Intricate veins of gold and white shimmer across its surface, constantly moving in subtle patterns, resembling the ethereal paths of divine energy coursing through the cosmos. When touched, the ingot feels paradoxically warm and cool, resonating with a calming hum that speaks to the latent, immeasurable power within.\n\nThe dwarves of Aul-Dwarov, known for their mastery over metal and stone, revered Aetherium as the pinnacle of material perfection. However, even their legendary forges and master smiths could not replicate the secrets of its creation, which had been lost in the mists of time before their empire's founding. This scarcity elevated Aetherium ingots to the status of holy relics, coveted not only for their beauty but also for the unmatched potential they held.\n\nLegends tell that Aetherium was the chosen material of the gods themselves, used to forge their indomitable weapons and armor. Its divine purity makes it immune to corruption and decay, and its strength is unparalleled—no mortal alloy can rival it.\n\nThe ingots, sealed away in the subterranean Vaults of Aul-Dwarov, became a symbol of reverence and a bitter reminder of their ancestors' limitations. With the rediscovery of these artifacts, the descendants of Aul-Dwarov now face an age-old question: what will they do with the divine legacy of the gods?"

Their smiths could now craft weapons sharper and armor more resilient than ever before, elevating the dwarves' industry to new heights.Though the secrets of Etherium remain elusive, its study ushered in a new age of prosperity and innovation, cementing the dwarves' status as the world's foremost masters of metal."

This is the Runic Heart, sealed away for centuries, its purpose and nature unknown. Ancient notes nearby explain its strange ability to replace a dwarf's heart, healing them and granting powers... for a price.\nThe notes found in the vault speak of the power and curse of the Runic Heart. The artifact can grant immense strength, speed, and magical ability, but these powers are unpredictable, sometimes even causing weaknesses in the user.
