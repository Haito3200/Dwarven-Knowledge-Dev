 DA_MT_Kobold_1_1_desc:0 "Kobold's biology is a true marvel.\nUnlike other races, we can boast almost 10 times the amount of metals in our blood and flesh than any other living being we know of.\nThis study can help us understand both ourselves and metallurgy better than our current limited knowledge allows."

 DA_MT_Kobold_3_2_desc:0 "As we rely on artificery more and more, some artificers have propose to apply our new found knowledge of metals and alloys to artificer regiments to further improve their military might and durability.\n\n§GYou will become able to redesign artificer equipment from the metallurgy menu§!"

 DA_MT_Kobold_1_2_1_desc:0 "The steel claws are our first prototype of offensive limb augmentation. Steel blades are added to the arms of the recipient, with the tangs welded to the bones of the forearms and the blade expanding from just above the wrist. While impractical in some cases, they allow a great range of use in combat situations that make them interesting to use nonetheless."

 DA_MT_Kobold_1_2_2_title:0 "Targeted Mutations"
 DA_MT_Kobold_1_2_2_desc:0 "early experimentation has shown that encasing the shards of damestear in specific casings improves the success rate of the operations, both in terms of potency of the mutations and in reduction in negative mutations. While many materials have been tried, copper and silver seem to yield the most results, both regarding our goals and in reducing infections, a minor but still present concern in our efforts. Further experimentation will allow us to refine our work and better select what mutations occur."

 DA_MT_Kobold_2_2_1_desc:0 "Several competing procedures bare this name, all with superficially similar results but far varying success rates. The two most common procedures consist in, respectively, pouring small amounts of molten bronze upon the scales of a kobold, or welding small bronze scales upon a kobold's natural scales. Naturally, the first has a lower success rate, but its results are also better and the procedure is faster, while the second is more time consuming but provides lesser benefits. Both can cohabit in our military, for different echelons of the army."

 DA_MT_Kobold_2_2_2_title:0 "Bone Molding"
 DA_MT_Kobold_2_2_2_desc:0 "We have managed to implant shards of damestear into bone tissue, resulting in bone growth in adults, a previously unrecorded event. Precise implantation of the shards can direct the bone growth, which can then be filed down to form as is required. As these bone growth are pure bone and contain no marrow, metallic additions can be welded and riveted to them with close to no risk to the health of the patient. "

 DA_MT_Kobold_3_2_1_desc:0 "Our tinkerers have long used the contents of captured workshops and laboratories to learn the craft of our enemies, and some measure of innovation has been born of these studies. Recently however, a critical mass of some kind seems to have been reached, and far more of our trapmasters and tinkerers are innovating and sharing ideas. This has lead to a trend of innovation targeted towards improving our physical abilities, much like the Gnomes do. Our path to improvement is different, however. The Gnomes focus on equipment and tools, but one can see their tools stolen, their armour sabotaged and their weapons broken. We seek a surer way to keep our tools about us : make them a part of us."

 DA_MT_Kobold_3_2_3_desc:0 "A major breakthrough has occurred. In an attempt to artificially increase the potency of mages, a workshop started implanting pieces of damestear into patients, with unexpected consequences. While the patients did not display increased magical potency, their physical abilities were notably improved, though in an irregular manner. These mutations, as the artificer has taken to calling them, were generally helpful, but not always. Often, multiple mutations occurred and merely conflicted with each other, nullifying one while weakening the other, but sometimes a fully deleterious mutation came to be, severely reducing the abilities of the patient, or even their lifespan. Nonetheless, this is a tremendous step in the right direction, indeed, how can our tools be any more a part of us than when they are grown from our own flesh ?"

 DA_MT_Kobold_3_2_4_desc:0 "Recent advances in optics have been used to look both farther and closer, and it is the later that interests us. But while the Cobalt dwarves looked at the smaller beings out of the body, we looked at ourselves and were confounded. We are made of smaller beings, similar to the germs so decried as goblins by the dwarves, yet very different. Much like our ancient clans and out modern state, we are made up of a hoard of smaller beings, all working in unison to push us forward. We must study these smaller beings that make us up, these small bricks of life that build us. Are these bricks similar in all organs, or are they specialized as we ourselves are ? Do they all work the same ? What is the content of this ball we can see in them ? Are they the reason why one cannot simply graft a dwarvish arm on a gnome ? We must know !"

 DA_MT_Kobold_4_2_1_desc:0 "By nailing metal plates to the bones of our soldiers, we can ensure that they are less vulnerable to bone breakages and, when they do experience them, the metal plates provide a built in splint. Early procedures were extremely failure prone, as the recipients seemed to die from sheer pain, until a mage tried to cast a sleep spell on a patient before the operation. Other workshops have taken to the same method, as it seems to increase success rate tremendously. Perhaps something to follow up on ..."

 DA_MT_Kobold_4_2_2_title:0 "Muscles Alteration"
 DA_MT_Kobold_4_2_2_desc:0 "Infection has plagued our efforts from the start, killing or maiming patients whose augmentations had succeeded. While some obvious trends were noticed - cleaner workshops resulted in better outcomes - it is time we invest time and money into determining the conditions that yield the best results. A simple, but invasive, procedure has been selected and a wide variety of methods have been selected for trial. Burning the tools, drenching them in acid, operating on copper or lead tables, in isolated rooms or in the workshop itself, different products to clean the rooms ... over 6 00 concurrent experiment chains will be held. We will have our answers."

 DA_MT_Kobold_5_2_1_desc:0 "After a rather gruelling process of trial and error, a workshop has developed a way for a mechanical assemblage of light pipes and canvas to interact with the recipients' muscles and spine, allowing for rudimentary flight. While true, self-powered flight is still out of our reach, the recipients of these augmentations can glide over significant distances when launching from a high point, or when benefiting from assistance in taking flight, such as modified ballistas. Some standardisation is required, however, as the results of such augmentations are very irregular, depending on both what metal and what textile is used in the process."

Sharper eyes, poison resistant lungs, sturdier hearts, all aspects of koboldhood can be improved with this method. One can only wonder what this could result in when coupled with our other innovations ... This must be explored further."
